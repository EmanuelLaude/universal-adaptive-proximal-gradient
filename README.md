# Adaptive proximal gradient methods are universal without approximation
This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments in the paper


**Adaptive proximal gradient methods are universal without approximation** (K. A. Oikonomidis, E. Laude, P. Latafat, A. Themelis, P. Patrinos; ICML 2024) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06271]


which has been accepted to ICML 2024

## Installation
to run the experiments simply call run the individual main files from within python

The underlying solver code is further maintained and extended under the name COMPOT (COMPosite Optimization Toolbox) in the repository https://github.com/EmanuelLaude/compot/
